25/06/19 11:50:11 WARN SparkOpenLineageExtensionVisitorWrapper: An illegal reflective access operation will occur when using the openlineage-spark integration with a Spark connector that implements spark-openlineage extension interfaces. 
This issue arises when the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using different classloaders. For example, if one library is loaded using the --jars parameter while the other is placed in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory. 
In this case, the OpenLineageExtensionProvider class will only be accessible to the class loader that loaded the openlineage-spark integration. If the other class loader attempts to access this class, it will trigger an illegal reflective access operation.
To prevent this, ensure that both the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using the same class loader. This can be achieved by: 
1. Placing both libraries in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory, or 
2. Loading both libraries through the --jars parameter.

25/06/19 11:50:20 WARN SparkOpenLineageExtensionVisitorWrapper: An illegal reflective access operation will occur when using the openlineage-spark integration with a Spark connector that implements spark-openlineage extension interfaces. 
This issue arises when the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using different classloaders. For example, if one library is loaded using the --jars parameter while the other is placed in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory. 
In this case, the OpenLineageExtensionProvider class will only be accessible to the class loader that loaded the openlineage-spark integration. If the other class loader attempts to access this class, it will trigger an illegal reflective access operation.
To prevent this, ensure that both the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using the same class loader. This can be achieved by: 
1. Placing both libraries in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory, or 
2. Loading both libraries through the --jars parameter.

25/06/19 11:50:20 WARN SparkOpenLineageExtensionVisitorWrapper: An illegal reflective access operation will occur when using the openlineage-spark integration with a Spark connector that implements spark-openlineage extension interfaces. 
This issue arises when the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using different classloaders. For example, if one library is loaded using the --jars parameter while the other is placed in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory. 
In this case, the OpenLineageExtensionProvider class will only be accessible to the class loader that loaded the openlineage-spark integration. If the other class loader attempts to access this class, it will trigger an illegal reflective access operation.
To prevent this, ensure that both the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using the same class loader. This can be achieved by: 
1. Placing both libraries in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory, or 
2. Loading both libraries through the --jars parameter.

25/06/19 11:50:20 WARN SparkOpenLineageExtensionVisitorWrapper: An illegal reflective access operation will occur when using the openlineage-spark integration with a Spark connector that implements spark-openlineage extension interfaces. 
This issue arises when the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using different classloaders. For example, if one library is loaded using the --jars parameter while the other is placed in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory. 
In this case, the OpenLineageExtensionProvider class will only be accessible to the class loader that loaded the openlineage-spark integration. If the other class loader attempts to access this class, it will trigger an illegal reflective access operation.
To prevent this, ensure that both the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using the same class loader. This can be achieved by: 
1. Placing both libraries in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory, or 
2. Loading both libraries through the --jars parameter.

25/06/19 11:50:21 WARN SparkOpenLineageExtensionVisitorWrapper: An illegal reflective access operation will occur when using the openlineage-spark integration with a Spark connector that implements spark-openlineage extension interfaces. 
This issue arises when the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using different classloaders. For example, if one library is loaded using the --jars parameter while the other is placed in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory. 
In this case, the OpenLineageExtensionProvider class will only be accessible to the class loader that loaded the openlineage-spark integration. If the other class loader attempts to access this class, it will trigger an illegal reflective access operation.
To prevent this, ensure that both the openlineage-spark integration and the Spark connector are loaded using the same class loader. This can be achieved by: 
1. Placing both libraries in the /usr/lib/spark/jars directory, or 
2. Loading both libraries through the --jars parameter.
